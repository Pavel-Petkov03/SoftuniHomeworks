# Hungry Hippos is a tabletop game made for 2â€“4 players, produced by Hasbro, under the brand of its subsidiary,
# Milton Bradley. The idea for the game was published in 1967 by toy inventor Fred Kroll and it was introduced in 1978.
# The objective of the game is for each player to collect as many marbles as possible with their 'hippo'
# (a toy hippo model).
# You will receive on the first line the rows of the matrix (n) and on the next n lines you will get each row of the
# matrix as a string (zeros and ones separated by a single space). You have to calculate how many blocks of food you
# have (connected ones horizontally or diagonally)
# Example: Here you have 2 blocks of food
