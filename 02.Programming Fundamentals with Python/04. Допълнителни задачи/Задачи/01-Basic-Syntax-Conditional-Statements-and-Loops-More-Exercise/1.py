# Hungry Hippos is a tabletop game made for 2â€“4 players,
# produced by Hasbro, under the brand of its subsidiary,
# Milton Bradley. The idea for the game was published in
# 1967 by toy inventor Fred Kroll and it was introduced in
# 1978. The objective of the game is for each player to collect
# as many marbles as possible with their 'hippo' (a toy hippo model).
# You will receive on the first line the rows of the matrix (n) and
# on the next n lines you will get each row of the matrix as a string
# (zeros and ones separated by a single space). You have to calculate how
# many blocks of food you have (connected ones horizontally or vertically)
# Example: Here you have 2 blocks of food
