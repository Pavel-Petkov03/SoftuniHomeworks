# This is your first task in your new job. You were tasked to create a list of the stock in a bakery and
# you really don't want to fail at you first day at work.
# You will receive a single line containing some food (keys) and quantities (values).
# They will be separated by a single space (the first element is the key, the second â€“ the value and so on).
# Create a dictionary with all the keys and values and print it on the console
