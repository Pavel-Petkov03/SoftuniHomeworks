# You are a mad scientist and you decided to play with electron distribution among atom's shells. You know that basic idea of electron distribution is that electrons should fill a shell until it's holding the maximum number of electrons.
# The rules for electron distribution are as follows:
# •	Maximum number of electrons in a shell is distributed with a rule of 2n^2 (n being position of a shell a.k.a. the list index + 1).
# •	For example, maximum number of electrons in 3rd shield is 2*3^2 = 18.
# •	Electrons should fill the lowest level shell first.
# •	If the electrons have completely filled the lowest level shell, the other unoccupied electrons will fill the higher level shell and so on

# all_h_employees = int(input()) + int(input()) + int(input())
# all_for_students = int(input())
# index = 0
# while all_for_students > all_h_employees:
# 	if index % 4 != 0 or index == 0:
# 		if all_for_students > all_h_employees:
# 			all_for_students -= all_h_employees
# 			index += 1
# 	else:
# 		index += 1
# if all_for_students:
# 	index += 1
#
# print(f'Time needed: {index}h.')
